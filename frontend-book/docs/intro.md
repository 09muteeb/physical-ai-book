# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the Physical AI Book, a comprehensive guide to connecting artificial intelligence with the physical world through robotics.

## About This Book

This book is designed for AI students and developers who are new to robotics. It provides a practical approach to understanding how AI systems can interact with physical robots, with a focus on the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the "nervous system" that connects AI logic to robot bodies.

## What You'll Learn

- How ROS 2 serves as the communication infrastructure for robotic systems
- Techniques for bridging AI algorithms with physical robot control
- Best practices for creating AI agents that interact with the physical world
- Practical examples of AI-robot integration

## Modules

This book is organized into modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of Physical AI:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding how ROS 2 connects AI to robot bodies
- Additional modules will be added in future updates

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this book, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of fundamental AI/ML concepts
- Interest in robotics and physical AI applications

Start with Module 1 to learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 and how it serves as the "nervous system" for robotic systems.
