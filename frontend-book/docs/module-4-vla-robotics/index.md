# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for LLM-Driven Robotics

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI Book. In this module, you'll learn about Vision-Language-Action systems, voice-to-action processing with OpenAI Whisper, cognitive planning with LLMs, and complete AI-driven humanoid workflows that combine voice, perception, planning, and navigation.

## What You'll Learn

- Voice-to-action processing with OpenAI Whisper for converting natural speech to actionable commands
- Integration of voice processing systems with ROS 2 for robot control
- Conceptual flow from voice input to robot understanding and action execution
- Cognitive planning with LLMs for translating natural language tasks into ROS 2 action sequences
- Planning algorithms and task decomposition for complex commands like "Clean the room"
- How to combine voice, perception, planning, and navigation in complete autonomous workflows
- High-level autonomous task execution for humanoid robots
- Complete AI-driven humanoid workflows that demonstrate integrated VLA capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (from Module 1)
- Knowledge of AI and language models
- Interest in voice-controlled robotics systems
