# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI Book. In this module, you'll learn about NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS for perception, and Nav2 for path planning - key technologies for creating AI-powered perception and navigation systems for humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- How Isaac Sim enables effective AI training in robotics
- Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception and VSLAM
- Sensor integration and environment mapping with Isaac ROS
- Real-time perception concepts using Isaac's acceleration
- Nav2 for navigation and path planning for bipedal robots
- Motion control concepts for legged robot navigation
- How to build a complete AI-to-robot decision pipeline

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (from Module 1)
- Knowledge of simulation and digital twins (from Module 2)
- Interest in advanced perception and navigation systems
